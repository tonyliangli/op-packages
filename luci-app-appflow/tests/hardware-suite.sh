# appflow hardware test suite.
#
# The behavioural claims this package makes that can be checked without a
# browser, as one runnable script. It exists because all of them had previously
# been verified only by ad-hoc commands typed once and thrown away, and because
# two of this daemon's defects were silent: they produced wrong numbers while
# every status field said things were fine.
#
# RUN IT ON A SANDBOX ROUTER. It restarts appflowd, resets its counters, and
# generates traffic. It does not modify configuration.
#
#   usage:  sh hardware-suite.sh              run everything
#           sh hardware-suite.sh conservation run one group
#                                             (health|conservation|conntrack|restart|acl)
#
# Exit status is the number of failed checks.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE CAN AND CANNOT CATCH, established by running it against the
# pre-fix v1.0.1 daemon on 2026-08-25, which is the only test of a test worth
# anything:
#
#   caught:      an old daemon with no conservation counters at all
#                (status.bytes missing), and any leak once they exist
#   NOT caught:  the reshadow double-count itself. The restart ratio came back
#                1.012 on the known-broken daemon, having been 0.70 and 0.79 on
#                two runs the day before. See the note in test_restart.
#
# Unlike the wansentry suite, nothing here reimplements the code under test:
# every check queries the running daemon over ubus. The weakness is coverage,
# not construction.
#
# WIRE TRUTH. Where a test needs to know how many bytes really moved, it reads
# the client veth's own counter in /sys/class/net. Nothing in appflowd can
# influence that number, which is the entire point: comparing appflow against
# appflow proves nothing.
#
# Requires: appflowd and netifyd running, root, and a network namespace client
# (see NETNS below) for the NAT tests. Groups that need the netns skip
# themselves with a clear message when it is absent rather than failing.

	# and being captured on both interfaces, and a sixty-second window does not
	# guarantee that.
