// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Every defect this package's frontend has had was found
// by a human or a review panel READING the code. Not one was found by a test,
// because until now no test could run any of it. The daemon has 54 checks
// against it and the JavaScript had none, which is backwards: the daemon
// mostly counts bytes, while the frontend is what decides whether an operator
// is told the collector is down.
//
//   usage:  node tests/frontend-suite.js
//
// Runs anywhere Node runs. No router, no browser, no network. The real
// common.js is loaded and executed by tests/luci-module.js; nothing in it is
// reimplemented here.
//
// EVERY CHECK IN THE FIRST THREE GROUPS IS A REGRESSION TEST FOR A DEFECT THAT
// WAS REAL, shipped, and fixed. They are not hypotheticals: each one names the
// date it was found and what it did to the screen.
//
// SABOTAGE COMMENTS: every check names the smallest edit to the PRODUCT that
// turns it red, written before the assertion.
