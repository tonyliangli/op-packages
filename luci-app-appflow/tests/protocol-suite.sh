# appflow protocol and bounds suite.
#
# The sibling suite, hardware-suite.sh, drives real traffic through a real
# netifyd and checks that the totals stay near wire truth. It is an integration
# test and its own header says the weakness is coverage: it can only assert on
# whatever netifyd happened to send during the window, so the arithmetic is
# checked loosely, the error paths are never reached at all, and a test either
# waits a minute or skips.
#
# This suite replaces netifyd with a socket WE control, so the input is exact
# and chosen. That buys three things the hardware suite cannot have:
#
#   1. Byte arithmetic checked against a hand-computed total rather than
#      against a ratio band. If the daemon adds one byte that netifyd did not
#      report, a check here goes red; the 0.80-1.25 ratio band cannot see it.
#   2. The error and bounds paths, which real netifyd never exercises:
#      malformed frames, oversized tags, a full flow table, a full aggregate
#      table, unknown event types, a peer that stops sending newlines.
#   3. Determinism. No traffic, no waiting on a transfer, no SKIP.
#
# It does NOT replace the hardware suite. Everything here is the daemon's view
# of a wire this file wrote, so nothing here can catch appflowd and netifyd
# disagreeing about what a field means. That is exactly what the hardware
# suite's wire-truth comparison is for, and neither suite subsumes the other.
#
#   usage:  sh protocol-suite.sh                  run everything
#           sh protocol-suite.sh conservation     run one group
#             (conservation|protocol|bounds|attribution|hostile|acl|lifecycle)
#
# RUN IT ON A SANDBOX ROUTER. It stops appflowd, repoints appflow.socket_path
# at a temporary socket, and restarts the daemon many times. It restores the
# original socket_path on exit, including on interrupt. It never touches
# netifyd's own configuration.
#
# Exit status is the number of failed checks.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# HOW TO READ THE `SABOTAGE:` COMMENTS, AND WHY THEY ARE THERE
#
# Every check below carries one. It names the smallest edit to appflowd -- the
# product, not this file -- that makes that check report failure, and it was
# written BEFORE the assertion it sits above.
#
# That ordering is the whole discipline. Asking "what does this test check"
# answers itself in the author's own words, which is how a test that cannot
# fail gets written and then read a dozen times without anyone noticing. Asking
# "what edit turns this red" is a construction task: either a concrete edit
# exists or you hit a wall, and the wall is the finding.
#
# They are also here so a reviewer can check this suite in sixty seconds rather
# than trusting it. Apply the named edit, run the group, and exactly the checks
# that name it should go red. If one of them stays green, that check is
# decorative and this comment is how you found out.
#
# An edit that makes the file unparseable does not count and none is used
# below: an error is not a red assertion, and it is the escape hatch every
# hollow test reaches for.

# Every suite in these two packages mutates GLOBAL router state: this one
# rewrites /etc/config/mwan3 and drives the mwan3 service, its sibling repoints
# appflow.socket_path and restarts appflowd. Two of them running at once
# corrupt each other's fixtures, and the failures look like product defects.
#
# That is not hypothetical. On 2026-08-26 two suites were launched a minute
# apart against the same router; the second reported two failures that could
# not be reproduced in isolation, and the ownership arithmetic was rewritten
# twice chasing a bug that was never there.
#
# One lock file for ALL suites across both packages, because the resource being
# protected is the router, not the config file.
# mkdir is atomic and is NOT a file descriptor, which is the whole point.
# The first version of this guard used `exec 9>lock; flock -n 9`. Every child
# inherits an fd, and these suites launch children that outlive them: socat
# serving the fake agent, and mwan3track respawned per interface by mwan3's
# init script. The lock therefore stayed held after the suite exited and the
# next suite in a serial run was refused. Observed: suite 1 passed, suites 2
# and 3 produced no output at all because both exited 2.

#
# TWO DEFECTS IN EARLIER DRAFTS OF THIS FUNCTION, both found by running it, and
# both worth keeping written down because they are the shape that makes a whole
# suite worthless rather than one check:
#
#   1. The range ended at `/}/`, which is the first closing brace ANYWHERE in
#      the group -- and `events` contains two nested objects, `unknown_types`
#      and `by_type`. So the range closed early and `rx_bytes`, `resyncs` and
#      `last_event_age_ms` were unreadable. Anchoring both ends to a single tab
#      of indentation is what fixes it.
#
#   2. Far worse: a key that could not be found returned the empty string, and
#      every caller wrote `${x:-0}`. Six checks in this suite assert that a
#      counter is exactly "0". Every one of them would have passed
#      unconditionally, for as long as the helper stayed broken, with the
#      daemon uninstalled entirely. That is the "loop over a property that does
#      not exist" trap wearing a different hat: not zero iterations, but a
#      default that happens to equal the expected value.
#
# So a miss now returns the literal MISSING, which equals no expected value and
# turns the check red. A test helper that cannot find its subject must fail
# loudly; returning a plausible number is how a suite starts lying.
