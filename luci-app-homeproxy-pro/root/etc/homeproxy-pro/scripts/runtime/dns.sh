# dnsmasq integration for homeproxy-pro.
#
# homeproxy-pro does not run its own DNS front end: it points dnsmasq at the
# sing-box DNS listener and, in the list-based routing modes, feeds it the
# per-domain `server=` / `nftset=` mappings.  All of that used to live inline
# in /etc/init.d/homeproxy-pro.
#
# Layering note: this is a device-side module.  It calls `log` and, in
# hp_dnsmasq_write_snippets, relies on `config_load` having run (see
# runtime/service.sh's header for the rationale).
#
# Sourced by /etc/init.d/homeproxy-pro.

# hp_dnsmasq_resolve_dir
# Locate the directory dnsmasq reads the homeproxy-pro snippets from and store it
# in the global DNSMASQ_DIR.
#
# The UCI section name of the dnsmasq config is part of
# /tmp/etc/dnsmasq.conf.<name>, but `uci get` cannot return a section name
# (there is no `__name__`), so it is derived from the first `uci show` line.
# Either step can fail on an unusual setup; fall back to the generic
# directory and say so in the log instead of silently writing dnsmasq
# snippets nobody reads.
#
# Called ONCE, at source time.  stop_service deliberately reuses the value
# instead of recomputing it: the directory must be the one the snippets were
# written to, and a second resolution could log the warning twice or pick a
# different directory after a dnsmasq reconfiguration.
