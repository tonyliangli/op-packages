# Configuration transaction helpers for homeproxy-pro.
#
# The generated sing-box configuration is the only thing standing between the
# router and a working service, so it is handled as a transaction:
#
#   generate            the generator writes atomically and only after
#                       `sing-box check` accepted the result, so a failed
#                       generation leaves the previous file in place
#     -> known-good     every accepted file is copied aside, so there is
#                       always something to fall back to
#     -> ensure-live    if generation produced nothing, restore the
#                       known-good copy instead of failing the start
#     -> rollback       a reload that comes up unhealthy puts the known-good
#                       copy back (see reload_service in init.d/homeproxy-pro)
#
# Sourced by /etc/init.d/homeproxy-pro.  The functions only take explicit paths
# and never call procd or ubus, so tests/runtime/test_config_transaction.sh
# can exercise them without a router.

# hp_restore_known_good_uci <good-dir>
# Re-apply the UCI snapshot written by hp_promote_known_good (the keys that
# steer the firewall / dnsmasq / nft layer - see HP_INTERCEPT_SCALARS in
# runtime/service.sh). Returns 0 on success, 1 when the snapshot is missing -
# the rollback path logs and continues, since a missing snapshot just means
# the install is older than the snapshot feature (best-effort).
#
# Two passes over the file, because the snapshot carries two shapes:
#
#   homeproxy-pro.<section>.<option>=<value>   scalar, replayed with `uci set`
#   list homeproxy-pro.<section>.<option>=a,b  UCI list, replayed with
#                                         `uci delete` + `uci add_list`
#
# A list replayed through `uci set` becomes a *string*, and the firewall
# validators (ipv4_to_nftarr / iface_to_nftarr) reject a non-array by
# returning null - so the ACL rules reading it would silently disappear and
# the rollback would come back with the wrong clients exempted.
#
# The commit below is what makes this safe: every write is staged and only
# becomes visible when uci commit succeeds.  A partial failure leaves UCI
# unchanged; the rollback caller logs and the next reload path will see the
# same failing configuration it just rolled back from, so the failure mode
# stays bounded (no new corruption).
