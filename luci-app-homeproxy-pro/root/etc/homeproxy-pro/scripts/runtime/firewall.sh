# fw4 integration for homeproxy-pro.
#
# homeproxy-pro owns a fixed set of nft chains and sets inside the `fw4` table.
# They are created by the rendered template (firewall_post.ut, applied by
# `fw4 reload`) and torn down one object at a time on stop.  All of that used
# to live inline in /etc/init.d/homeproxy-pro.
#
# Layering note: this is a device-side module.  It calls `log` and, for the
# teardown, requires the HP_FW4_CHAINS / HP_FW4_SETS inventory to be in scope
# (root/etc/homeproxy-pro/scripts/fw4_names.sh, sourced by init.d).
#
# Sourced by /etc/init.d/homeproxy-pro.

# hp_restore_upnp_mappings
# fw4 reload rewrites the whole ruleset, which drops the miniupnpd mappings,
# so ask miniupnpd to reinstall them - but only when it is actually enabled
# and running.
