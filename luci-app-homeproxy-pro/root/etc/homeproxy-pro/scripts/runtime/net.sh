# Routing/network plumbing for homeproxy-pro.

# The tproxy and TUN paths need ip rules, a routing table and (for TUN) the
# device itself before procd starts sing-box, and they need to be torn down
# again on stop.  All of that used to live inline in /etc/init.d/homeproxy-pro.
#
# Layering note: this is a device-side module.  It calls `log` and, like the
# other runtime modules, requires `config_load` to have run (it reads the
# infra marks and the TUN device name itself).
#
# Sourced by /etc/init.d/homeproxy-pro.

# hp_net_wait_wan [seconds]
# Block until a default route or an "up" wan interface exists.  Bounded: after
# the timeout sing-box is started anyway, because a missing default route is
# a common transient state at boot and refusing to start would be worse.
