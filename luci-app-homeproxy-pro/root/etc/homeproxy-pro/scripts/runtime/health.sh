# Runtime health helpers for homeproxy-pro.
#
# After a reload the service must be able to answer "did the instance
# actually come up with the new configuration?".  That answer decides whether
# the transaction in runtime/config.sh rolls back, so it is kept here instead
# of being inlined in init.d/homeproxy-pro.
#
# A single "is a matching process alive?" probe is NOT a health check, and the
# first version of this file learned that the hard way.  Measured on the test
# device with a configuration whose mixed_port was already taken:
#
#   * procd restarts the crashing instance about once a second, and a STALE
#     sing-box process from an earlier run kept matching `pgrep -f`, so the
#     process check returned success for the whole observation window while
#     the service was dead;
#   * `ubus service list` was correct throughout: `running` flipped false and
#     `exit_code` was 1 whenever it was down;
#   * the configured port WAS listening - owned by the process that had taken
#     it, not by sing-box.  Checking "the port is in the listen table" would
#     therefore have passed too; the listener has to be attributed to an owner.
#
# So the gate is: procd says running, procd does not report a failed exit
# code, the declared listeners are owned by sing-box, and that holds for
# several consecutive samples (a service that binds and then dies must not be
# able to pass on a single lucky poll).
#
# Sourced by /etc/init.d/homeproxy-pro; testable off-target by stubbing pgrep /
# ubus / jsonfilter / netstat (see tests/runtime/).

# How many consecutive healthy samples hp_wait_service requires, and how many
# seconds it may spend trying.
#
# Measured on the test device: procd waits out `procd_set_param respawn`'s
# timeout (5s) before restarting a dead instance, and after a crash-restart
# sequence has exhausted its retries the next start takes longer still.  A
# crash-restart loop produced at most one healthy sample in a row, so 3
# separates the two cases while a healthy start only costs ~3s; but the BUDGET
# has to cover procd's backoff, otherwise the gate gives up on an instance that
# is still coming up (observed with a 15s budget: the rollback restart was
# healthy moments after the gate had already declared failure).

# --- functional probes -----------------------------------------------------
#
# Everything above answers "is the instance up, and does it own the ports it
# declared?".  None of it answers "does it actually serve?".  A configuration
# can pass `sing-box check`, bind every listener, hold them for the whole
# observation window - and still not resolve a name, because the DNS router
# failed to initialize or a jail mount is missing.
#
# The probes below add that layer, deliberately as *evidence* first and as a
# gate only when asked for:
#
#   * "cannot probe" is reported separately from "the probe failed", so a
#     target without nslookup/nc does not look like a broken service;
#   * a failure only fails the gate when health_probe_strict is on. A probe
#     can fail for reasons that have nothing to do with sing-box - no uplink,
#     a captive portal, an upstream resolver outage - and rolling a perfectly
#     good configuration back because of that is worse than the condition
#     being probed for. A rollback loop is the failure mode to avoid here.
#
# The client side is the side with a fixed capability worth probing (its DNS
# inbound and the mixed inbound). The server side's inbounds are
# protocol-specific: a bare TCP connect to a REALITY/trojan port proves
# nothing, so it is not probed.
