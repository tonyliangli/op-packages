# Service-side runtime helpers for homeproxy-pro.
#
# These are the device-side orchestration pieces that used to be inlined in
# /etc/init.d/homeproxy-pro: the sing-box version gate, the auto-update cron
# entry, the runtime-file preparation, the procd instance registrations and
# the "generate -> known-good" transaction that start_service runs for each
# side.
#
# Layering note: unlike
# runtime/config.sh and runtime/health.sh - which are deliberately pure and
# only take explicit paths - the extracted modules are device-side
# by nature.  They call `log`, `config_get` and `procd_*`, so a caller must
# have run `config_load` and must be inside a procd init context.  That is
# exactly why they were moved out of init.d and not turned into pure helpers.
#
# Sourced by /etc/init.d/homeproxy-pro.

# hp_require_singbox
# Refuse to start on a sing-box older than 1.14: the generated configuration
# uses 1.14-only fields, and an older binary would reject it at run time
# instead of failing here.  Returns 1 (and logs) when unusable.
#
# `sing-box` is looked up through PATH, exactly as the previous init script
# did - it is deliberately not PROG, so a PATH mismatch between the two is
# not silently introduced by this refactor.

# hp_require_ucode
# Refuse to start when the installed ucode cannot load this package's own
# modules at all.  Returns 1 (and logs) when the interpreter is unusable.
#
# Why a check and not a documented requirement: ucode resolves `import` when a
# module is LOADED, not when a function is called, and homeproxy-pro.uc imports
#
#     import { access, lstat, mkdtemp, open, rmdir, unlink } from 'fs';
#
# so on a ucode whose fs module has no `mkdtemp` export, *every* entry point
# into this package dies with the same one-line reference error at load time -
# the install-time migration (etc/uci-defaults/luci-homeproxy-pro-migration),
# both config generators, and the LuCI RPC module that imports homeproxy-pro.uc
# too.  The first of those to run is the migration, which is why the only
# thing an affected user ever saw was a stack trace during `apk add` /
# `opkg install` (issue #3) and never a sentence naming the requirement.
#
# `mkdtemp` entered ucode on 2025-11-07 (lib/fs.c, "fs: add mkdtemp() method
# for creating temporary directories").  It replaced `mkstemp`, which every
# older ucode does export - so this is a hard floor, not a preference, and no
# ImmortalWrt 24.10 release can satisfy it.
#
# The probe is `ucode -e`, the same form tests/ucode/run.sh uses for its
# module syntax checks.  Its own output is not discarded: if this ucode is so
# old that even the probe fails, that is exactly the information the operator
# needs, so the error goes into the log next to the requirement.

# It deliberately does NOT touch the known-good copy any more.  It used to
# record the freshly generated file immediately, which meant that by the time
# the health gate ran, the "previous" configuration the rollback would need had
# already been overwritten by the candidate - so a failed reload had nothing to
# roll back to.  Promotion is now a separate step, taken only after the gate
# has passed (hp_promote_known_good, called from start_service).
#
# A3: the candidate flag exists because the generator is no longer guaranteed to
# produce the same bytes twice - its env carries the WAN resolver and the two
# domain-resource lists, either of which can change between two invocations. A
# reload that generated the config, validated it, and then let start_service
# generate it *again* would run an artifact that had never been checked:
# validate A -> discard A -> generate B -> run B. The flag makes the validated
# bytes the ones that run. It is per side, so a config_load disagreement between
# reload_service and start_service (a concurrent UCI change) generates the side
# the preflight did not cover instead of activating a stale file.

# always empty and the restore was a silent no-op; the golden trace recorded
# the empty line as expected, which is how the defect survived.  tests/
# arch-guard.sh guard 43 derives the read set from the layer consumers and
# compares it against this list in both directions.
#
# The two TUN address keys are the one deliberate inclusion that no layer
# consumer reads: the address is only ever installed by the generated sing-box
