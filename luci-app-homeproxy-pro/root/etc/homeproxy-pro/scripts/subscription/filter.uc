 *   - tls.insecure is set when the node has TLS enabled and the user opted in
 *     via subscription.allow_insecure='1'
 *   - protocol_options.packet_encoding is set on vless/vmess nodes to the
 *     subscription's default
 *
 * This used to run on the flat dict, which is why the orchestrator applied
 * policy on one representation and handed a different one to the Repository.
 * The canonical Node is now the only business object between the parser and
 * the Repository, and this was the last step still forcing the flat shape.
 * The tweaks are a property of the subscription, not of the parsed link, so
 * they deliberately do not take part in the duplicate fingerprint - which is
 * computed from the parser output before this runs.
