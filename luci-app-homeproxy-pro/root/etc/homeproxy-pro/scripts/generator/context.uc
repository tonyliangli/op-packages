 * Why the split exists: this module used to sit inside generator/client.uc
 * and resolve `env` itself - it called `ubus network.interface status` for
 * the WAN DNS and `readfile()` for the two resource lists. The generator was
 * documented as a pure function while depending on live router state, so
 * "generate the same config twice" was not guaranteed. That is what made
 * reload's preflight generation and start_service's generation two different
 * artifacts in principle: the WAN lease can change between them.
 *
 * Now the impure part (ubus call, resource read, mode-dependent fallback for
 * a router with no lease) belongs to the CLI shells - scripts/
 * generate_client.uc and scripts/generate_server.uc - which are the
 * process-level boundary and already own the atomic write and
 * `sing-box check`. Everything under generator/ is a pure function of its
 * arguments, which tests/arch-guard.sh enforces (guard 27: no ubus/fs import
 * in generator/).
 *
 * `env` is allowed to be partial. A missing wan_dns still yields the same
 * public fallback the pre-split code used, as a pure function of the routing
 * mode - not a probe - so a caller that has no ubus keeps producing a valid
 * config instead of failing.
