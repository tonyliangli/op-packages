# Report how much of the gettext template (po/templates/homeproxy-pro.pot) is
# translated in po/zh_Hans/homeproxy-pro.po. Missing, empty and fuzzy entries all
# count as untranslated. The check only warns by default so it does not block
# a build; pass --fail-below to turn the warning into a failure.
#
# A template that parses to fewer than MIN_TOTAL non-ignored entries is a hard
# failure regardless of flags: an empty or truncated .pot makes every
# percentage meaningless, and a coverage number must not be allowed to report
# 100% for a translation set that covers nothing.
#
# Two defects are hard failures whatever the flags say, because neither shows
# up in the percentage: a msgstr whose placeholders do not match its msgid, and
# a msgstr that repeats a 20+ character run of itself.
#
# Usage:
#   tests/i18n-coverage.py                       # warn below 95%
#   tests/i18n-coverage.py --warn-below 90
#   tests/i18n-coverage.py --fail-below 95

# failing on a legitimate future removal of some strings.  0 must never be

# that occurs twice inside one msgstr fails the check, whatever --fail-below
# says.
#
# Exclusion rule (why the markup-heavy entries in this catalogue do not trip
# it): LuCI strings mix prose with HTML, so a *correct* translation can repeat
# a structural run many times, e.g. the default-rule entry carries
# "</code> &&<br/><code>(port || port_range)" three times over.  Those tags are
# template scaffolding, not translated wording, so every <...> tag is stripped
# before the scan.  A duplicated clause keeps far more than 20 characters of
# real text after stripping, while the longest structural run above collapses
# to ") &&(" - below the threshold.  Without the strip that entry would be a
# false positive.
