# Functional health probes (runtime/health.sh).
#
# The process/listener gate answers "is the instance up and does it own its
# ports?".  It cannot answer "does it actually serve?", and the probes that do
# are on the same code path a rollback is decided on - so the one property that
# must not regress is that they only *report* by default.  A probe that fails
# because the uplink is down, or because this target has no nslookup/nc, must
# never be able to fail the gate: a rollback loop is worse than the condition
# being probed for.
#
# `health_probe_strict` (UCI) is the opt-in that turns a probe failure into a
# gate failure.  "Cannot probe here" stays non-fatal even then - there is
# nothing to conclude from a missing tool.
#
# The probes take explicit ports and shell out to nslookup/nc, so this runs
# anywhere without ucode, procd or a router.
#
# Usage: sh tests/runtime/test_health_probe.sh <repo-root>
