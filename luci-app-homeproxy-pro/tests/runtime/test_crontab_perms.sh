# hp_crontab_drop() rewrites /etc/crontabs/root through a temporary file, and
# `mv` replaces the *file*, not its contents: the temporary carries the shell's
# umask (0644) while procd creates the root crontab as 0600.  Every stop/start
# therefore left it world-readable - confirmed on the device (0600 after a
# boot, 0644 after one reload) - and a root crontab can hold other jobs'
# secrets.
#
# The function takes the crontab path as an argument and the module is
# device-side, so this drives it against a sandboxed file and never touches the
# host's own crontab.
#
# Usage: sh tests/runtime/test_crontab_perms.sh <repo-root> [workdir]
