# root/etc/config/homeproxy-pro ships as the package conffile and is what every
# fresh install starts from, but nothing ever read it: the form tests render
# against their own fixtures, the generator tests stage a fixture, and the two
# factory-ish UCI files were only ever checked by eye. A typo in a section name
# or an option the Loader looks for under a different name would ship to every
# new install and only show up as a form full of defaults.
#
# tests/json-assets.js validates the file's grammar; this drives it through the
# real Loader, which is what actually consumes it.

# Usage: sh tests/ucode/test_factory_config.sh <repo-root> [workdir]
