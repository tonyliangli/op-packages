# The subscription updater has to actually run.
#
# update_subscriptions.uc used to read subscription_urls and filter_keywords
# off access_control.subscription, while the Loader puts them on access_control
# itself.  Both came back [], so `if (!isEmpty(subscription_urls)) call(main)`
# was false: the script exited 0 having logged nothing, and both the LuCI
# "Update nodes from subscriptions" button and the cron entry were silent
# no-ops.  Nothing caught it because no test had ever executed main() - the
# repository test calls apply_nodes() directly, and the model test asserted the
# *correct* shape, which only made the consumer's wrong read look fine.
#
# So this test drives the real script end to end and asserts the one property
# that was missing: given a configured subscription URL, the updater must
# attempt an update and say something about the outcome.  The URL points at a
# closed port, so the attempt fails fast and main() returns before the
# `/etc/init.d/homeproxy-pro reload` at its end - the device is not touched.
#
# Usage: sh tests/ucode/test_subscription_updater_runs.sh <repo-root> [workdir]
