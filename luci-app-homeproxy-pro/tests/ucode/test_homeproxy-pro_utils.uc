 * accepts exactly the option list read off the applet on a real device and
 * rejects everything else the way the applet does.  The accepted set is PINNED
 * rather than inherited from the host, which is the part that was missing.

 * byte sequence, and the test is about the function answering correctly for
 * the format's own identity, not about how the constant was spelled.
 *
 * Returns are 'binary' | 'source' | null, and the null cases carry most of
