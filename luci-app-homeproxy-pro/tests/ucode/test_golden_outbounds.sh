# Golden snapshot for the protocol adapter.
#
# Builds one outbound per protocol with tests/fixtures/generators/outbounds.uci
# and diffs the result against tests/snapshots/generator/outbounds.json.
# Adding a protocol field, renaming a sing-box option or reordering the field
# tables shows up as a reviewable diff instead of passing silently.
#
# This replaces tests/ucode/test_demo_architecture.sh, which imported the
# production OutboundFactory and compared it against generate_outbound() - the
# same function - so it could never fail.
#
#   HP_UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 sh tests/ucode/test_golden_outbounds.sh <repo-root>
# regenerates the snapshot (review the diff before committing it).
#
# Without sing-box on PATH the diff still runs but the schema check is only
# reported as NOT RUN (degraded). HP_REQUIRE_SINGBOX=1 turns that into a
# failure; it mirrors HP_REQUIRE_FW4 in test_firewall_template.sh.
#
# Usage: sh tests/ucode/test_golden_outbounds.sh <repo-root> [work-dir]
