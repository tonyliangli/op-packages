# resource_blob_sha.uc: the git blob id helper the resource updater verifies
# downloads with.
#
# The check it feeds is only as good as this digest, so the expected values
# here are git's own: `git hash-object` on the same bytes, which is the oracle
# the helper has to reproduce (sha1("blob <len>\0" + content)). The fixtures
# are chosen to cover the two things an implementation gets wrong quietly:
# the empty file (a real blob id, not "no digest") and content whose byte
# length differs from its character count.
#
# Usage: sh tests/ucode/test_resource_blob_sha.sh <repo-root> [workdir]
