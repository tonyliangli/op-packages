 * What the UI does when an RPC does not answer.  Two paths, both of which
 * used to state something false rather than admit ignorance.
 *
 * getBuiltinFeatures() goes through rpcCall(), which resolves to `{}` when the
 * call does not come back. The protocol list used to be filtered against that
 * map unconditionally, so an empty map hid every feature-gated protocol
 * (hysteria, hysteria2, naive, tuic, wireguard). A node already saved as one
 * of them then rendered with no matching Select option, and LuCI's
 * AbstractValue.parse() writes whenever formvalue != cfgvalue - so the next
 * Save & Apply silently rewrote the node's `type` to whichever protocol came
 * first. Silent protocol change, from a failed status RPC.
 *
 * No test could see it: luci-form-snapshot.js always passes the fully
 * populated feature map (and its rpc stub always resolves), so the empty-map
 * path was never taken.
 *
 * Usage: node tests/frontend-feature-fallback.js <repo-root>
