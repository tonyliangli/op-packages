# Architecture Guard.
#
# Static, cross-file invariants that the behavioural suites cannot see because
# each of them only exercises one layer at a time.  Every guard here exists
# because a real defect slipped through the whole suite:
#
#   guard 1  the generators read the UCI configuration through
#            HP_DIR + '/config', i.e. /etc/homeproxy-pro/config/homeproxy-pro - a path
#            that exists nowhere.  uci.load() returned null, every uci.get()
#            returned null, and the Loader silently produced pure defaults, so
#            every generated config lacked the main-out, the route/dns finals
#            and all of the user's ports and nodes.  The staged tests passed
#            because the test rewrote HP_DIR and staged the fixture wherever
#            the code happened to look.
#
#   guard 2  update_subscriptions.uc read subscription_urls and filter_keywords
#            off access_control.subscription, but the Loader puts them on
#            access_control itself.  Both were always [], so the updater's
#            `if (!isEmpty(subscription_urls))` guard never called main(): the
#            LuCI button and the cron entry were silent no-ops that exited 0.
#            The project's own model test asserted the *correct* shape, which
#            is exactly why the consumer's wrong read was never questioned.
#
# The lesson both share: a test that stages its own inputs cannot notice that
# production reads a different place.  These guards compare the layers to each
# other instead of comparing each layer to a fixture.
#
# POSIX sh + python3 for the scanners python is better at.  No ucode,
# no node.  Run:
#   sh tests/arch-guard.sh [repo-root]

# replaying a UCI snapshot of the keys that steer the network layer - the
# second half exists because start_service reinstalls the nft / dnsmasq
# layer from CURRENT UCI, so without it a rollback would restore the sing-box
# bytes and leave the failing layer in place (review P1-3, 2026-09-28).
#
# That snapshot was a hand-maintained five-line list. It named four real
# keys out of the twenty-two the layer reads, and the fifth line was
# `infra.tun_address` - an option that exists nowhere; the real ones are
# `tun_addr4` / `tun_addr6` (config/loader.uc). So the line was always empty,
# the replay was a no-op for it, and tests/fixtures/runtime/trace.golden.txt
# recorded the empty line as the expected shape. A test that pins the format
# cannot notice that a key does not exist.
#
# The lesson is the one this file already states: compare the layers to each
# other instead of to a hand-written list. The read set below is extracted
# from the four files that actually build the intercept layer, and the two
# directions are checked:
#
#   read - snapshot   a key the layer reads was left out of the rollback
#   snapshot - read   a key nothing reads is in the rollback (the ghost-key
#                     case; the declared extras below are the only ones
#                     allowed)
#
# init.d/homeproxy-pro is deliberately NOT in the read set: its config_get calls
# serve the health gate (health_probe_*) and the cron (subscription.*), which
# do not steer the layer. Every key it reads that *does* steer the layer is
# also read by firewall_post.ut, so nothing is lost by excluding it.
# Pure shell on purpose: the first version of this guard ran the extraction
# from a python3 heredoc, and dash (which is what `sh` is on CI, and what
# tests/run.sh:176 invokes it with) did not recognise the heredoc inside the

echo "== guard 51: the format probe stays a probe, and the form stops fighting it =="

# issue #7 batch 1 turned a comment into a mechanism: generation reads the first
# bytes of each rule-set file and declares `format` from that, and a bare
# `update_interval` is normalised before sing-box parses it as a Go duration.
#
# Every part of that is a decision that can be undone by a well-meaning edit,
# and each reversion reproduces a failure that is invisible until a router
# refuses to start:
#
#   (a) the disk half of the probe moving under generator/ - the purity
#       invariant guard 27 protects, but at a different boundary than the one
#       it watches (guard 27 bans the fs/ubus IMPORT; this bans the CALL, so
#       a generator could reach the disk through a helper in homeproxy-pro.uc and
#       still pass guard 27)
#   (b) the probe reimplemented on isBinary() - which answers "is this text?",
#       a question correlated with the format rather than equal to it (see the
#       comment on ruleSetFormatFromBytes for why that correlation is luck)
#   (c) update_interval passing through raw again, which is the measured
#       `time: missing unit in duration "3600"` hard failure
#   (d) the form's `format` option growing a default back, which is what made
#       "add a local rule-set, pick my .json, forget Format" produce a
#       configuration that parsed JSON as a compiled .srs
#   (e) the update_interval placeholder showing a unit Go cannot read, which
#       is how `1d` got there in the first place

# guard 56: no `{% set %}` tag assigns the result of a function call.
#
# utpl's set tag takes a plain expression and rejects a call outright:
# `{% set x = f(); %}` is a parse error.  The damage is disproportionate to
# the typo, because a parse error kills the whole render - firewall_post.ut
# produces a zero-byte fw4_post.nft, fw4 has nothing new to load, and the
# health gate quietly keeps the previous ruleset.  Nothing looks broken: the
# service is up, the proxy works, and the template change is simply absent.
# r41 shipped such a line and never rendered once; r43 fixed it.
#
# So the rule is mechanical and worth pinning: inside a set tag, no `(`.
