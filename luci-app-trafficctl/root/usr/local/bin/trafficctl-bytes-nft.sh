# Per-device byte counters using nftables maps.
# Works with software flow offload (hook priority -200, before flowtable at -150).
# Output: JSON array
#   [{"ip":"…","bytes_in":N,"bytes_out":N,"bytes_tcp":-1,"bytes_udp":-1,
#     "src":"nft","degraded":false}]
#
# "degraded" is always false here, and that is the entire point of this script:
# these counters sit ahead of the flowtable, so they keep moving under offload
# where conntrack freezes. If this path is unavailable, trafficctl-bytes.sh
# reports degraded:true instead of quietly handing back frozen numbers.
#
# The counters here are cumulative since the table was created, unlike the
# conntrack sums trafficctl-bytes.sh returns, which cover live flows only.
# "src" lets trafficctl-totals.sh notice the swap and rebaseline instead of
# accumulating the whole map as a single enormous delta.
#
# The protocol split is -1, i.e. "unknown", not 0: a `type ipv4_addr : counter`
# map is keyed by address alone, so there is nothing here to split TCP from UDP
# with. Reporting 0 would render as a device that sent no TCP at all.

# Create table/maps/chain/rules if not already present (idempotent).
#
# The gate matches the CURRENT rule orientation, not merely "some rule exists".
# Until 1.13.x the maps were keyed the other way round (bytes_in by saddr), so
# a router upgrading from that version already has the chain: a looser check
# would leave the old, inverted rules in place forever and the fix would only
# ever reach fresh installs.
#
# Direction convention, matching trafficctl-bytes.sh and docs/API.md:
#   bytes_in  = traffic toward the device  (download) -> keyed by ip daddr
#   bytes_out = traffic from the device    (upload)   -> keyed by ip saddr

    # resets the counters once, on upgrade; they are only used for speed
    # deltas, so a single discarded sample is the whole cost.
